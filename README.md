# DS---Guess-a-random-Number
I am interested in guessing something to have fun for leisure...

Idea: Due to this program I can have fun and at the same, it plays the power of my instinct. With this program, I will know how many times before the user guesses the correct answer. This program might apply in the real world to security and monitoring wherein you have the power to know how many times they take before getting the right password or answer.
